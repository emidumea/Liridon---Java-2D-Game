# Liridon---2D-Java-Game
Made an 2D Java Platformer Game using rigorous OOP principles

- Applied advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism to create a modular, reusable, and maintainable codebase
- Implemented key design patterns to streamline game development, such as the Factory pattern for creating game
objects dynamically and the Singleton pattern to manage global game state instances
- Developed a game state management system to handle different game states (e.g., menu, playing, paused) and
transitions between them, ensuring a seamless user experience and easier management of game logic
- Engineered a robust animation system using Java 2D API for smooth character animations. Implemented sprite
flipping and scaling techniques for dynamic character movement
- Developed custom collision detection mechanisms using bounding boxes to ensure accurate and efficient interactions
between game objects, while simulating realistic physics including gravity, movement, and jump mechanics
- Designed a high-performance game loop to handle real-time updates and rendering, ensuring smooth gameplay, and
integrated user input handling with KeyListener to provide responsive and intuitive control over character actions.
